              Hello, thank you for stopping by to read my portfolio. This is a work in progress. After a break from programming, and a battle with inner conflicts about programming as a discipline as a whole, I have come back with greater insight into the use and benefits of programming. I hope to develop clean software, with the goal to understand the problem before building it, and I hope not to overindulge in the nuances of software development but rather focusing first, on the theoretical understanding of computer science, physics, and maths.
